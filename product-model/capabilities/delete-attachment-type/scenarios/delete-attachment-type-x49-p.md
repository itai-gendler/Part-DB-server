# Delete attachment type — Web tree-deletion path (Public Web)

## Trigger

The caller requests nonrecursive file-classification removal where surviving children must be reparented.

## Outcome

An accepted nonrecursive removal reparents children; applicable direct references can prevent deletion. Web recursive deletion first checks the reached descendants; MCP has no recursive option.

## Edge cases

- REST resource deletion does not inherit this explicit tree-deletion acceptance.
