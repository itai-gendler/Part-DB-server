# Create manufacturer — Authenticated Web refusal

## Trigger

The caller requests create manufacturer and reaches its closed entry or disabled-control result.

## Outcome

The creation controls remain disabled and no new Manufacturer is established; a uniform explicit server create-denial check is not asserted.
