# Withdraw stock — Rounded quantity exceeding balance stops completion (Public Web)

## Trigger

The caller requests withdrawal whose effective rounded quantity exceeds the known balance.

## Outcome

The over-balance request does not complete; helper RuntimeException is not promised the MCP expected-error envelope.
