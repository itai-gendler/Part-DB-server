# Only callers admitted by the resolved account configuration may remove Part lot information

Direct Web/nested reconciliation removal follows enclosing Part edit. Concrete standalone REST removal delegates the original delete attribute to the associated Part, while class/unassociated fallback uses parts.edit. Zero-balance withdrawal or movement cleanup follows the originating stock operation and its owner condition without an additional delete voter. Removal with an accepted enclosing Part follows the holder’s authority.

## Rationale

Authority is supplied by the resolved User’s stored Permission overrides and the consulted Group chain. Explicit User values win; unresolved inheritance is denied. An authenticated token already carrying a disabled User is refused before permission lookup. Anonymous Web requests resolve the reserved anonymous User identity. PAT and OAuth role/scope ceilings are applied before inherited permission resolution and cannot enlarge User authority. REST and KiCad require authenticated api.access_api; MCP requires authenticated api.use_mcp and endpoint enablement, with editing enablement on the explicit write processors. The initiating API client, AI agent or KiCad client remains the caller; its authenticated User supplies authority rather than a fictitious stored caller registry.
