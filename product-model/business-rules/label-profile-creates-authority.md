# Only callers admitted by the resolved account configuration may create Label profile information

The selected profile operation uses labels.create_profiles. Inline save/update performs its explicit respective check; standalone generic Web creation retains its read-entry and disabled-control boundary rather than an inferred uniform explicit create-denial.

## Rationale

Authority is supplied by the resolved User’s stored Permission overrides and the consulted Group chain. Explicit User values win; unresolved inheritance is denied. An authenticated token already carrying a disabled User is refused before permission lookup. Anonymous Web requests resolve the reserved anonymous User identity. PAT and OAuth role/scope ceilings are applied before inherited permission resolution and cannot enlarge User authority. REST and KiCad require authenticated api.access_api; MCP requires authenticated api.use_mcp and endpoint enablement, with editing enablement on the explicit write processors. The initiating API client, AI agent or KiCad client remains the caller; its authenticated User supplies authority rather than a fictitious stored caller registry.
